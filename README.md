**Overview**
Welcome to the thrilling world of stock analysis! ðŸš€ 

In this electrifying project, I embarked on a data adventure using the power of macros and VBA scripts to decode thousands of rows across multiple worksheets.

Volume of Stock: Unraveling the trading activity to understand the pulse of the market.
Open and Close Prices: Illuminating the dawn and dusk of each trading day.
Conditional Formatting: Adding a touch of magic to highlight key insights amidst the sea of data.
Greatest Increase, Decrease, and Total Volume: Unveiling the champions and underdogs of the stock market arena.
